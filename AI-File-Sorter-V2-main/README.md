# AI File Organizer

An intelligent file organization system that uses machine learning to automatically categorize and sort files based on their names, extensions, and content patterns.

## Features

- 🤖 AI-powered file categorization using multiple methods:
  - Extension-based matching
  - Keyword-based matching
  - Machine learning prediction
- 📁 Comprehensive file type support:
  - Documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT, etc.)
  - Media files (Images, Videos, Audio)
  - Code files (Python, JavaScript, etc.)
  - Design files (PSD, AI, FIGMA)
  - Modern formats (GDOC, NOTION, AIRTABLE)
- 🔍 Advanced pattern recognition:
  - Date patterns
  - Version numbers
  - Status indicators
- 💾 Automatic backup creation
- 📊 Progress tracking and reporting

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
[git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-file-organizer.git](https://github.com/SrinivasPaiM/AI-file-sorter-V2)
